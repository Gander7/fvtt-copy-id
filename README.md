# fvtt-copy-id
Foundry VTT Module that adds a button to copy the link ID of entities like actors for use elsewhere into the clipboard. You can achieve the same by drag-and-dropping it into a journal page and copying that out. 
This module simply gives a little button to some windows to make it easier.  It will use the full foundry journal format (like `@Item[IokSbCSael7Hc8Cq]{Driftglobe}` or `@Scene[xdntImH0Xubnfk41]{Worldmap}`)

## Motivation
I startet using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for my campaign information. But since I also wanted the information to be available in Foundry I import them with the [lava-flow](https://github.com/Praxxian/lava-flow) module. Since I write the stuff outside of Foundry however, I can't easily link actors and items in my files.   
This is why I made this little module to make that workflow easier. And in case anyone has the same problem I thought to publish this module as well.   
  
This is my first module in Foundry so excuse any mistakes and gladly submit feedback in some form or another.

## Credits
I took inspiration on how to add the buttons from [actor-link-indicator](https://github.com/saif-ellafi/foundryvtt-actor-link-indicator) and [item-macro](https://github.com/Kekilla0/Item-Macro).
